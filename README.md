A compilation of my solutions to a number of programming problems, solved using Python

1. maxlength_of_ones: In any list containing ones and zeros, find the maximum number of ones which exist consecutive to each other.2

2. two_straight_zeros: In a two dimensional array containing zeros and ones, compute the number of occurences of two zeros next to each other in a straight line, either horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.
